Hi there, it's me, Bill. I apologize that this site had not been updated in over five years. I've intended to update my site in that time, but everything else got in the way, and I was paralyzed with options to manage my personal website in a way that seemed consistent with my background as a web technologist.

Specifically, I wanted to have a personal website that was:

1. Easy to develop
1. Version-controlled
1. Minimalistic in code and layout
1. Static, and possible to host statically
1. Browser-performant
1. Open-source

I had been tangentially aware of a bunch of static-site generators for a while, and like the simpleton I am, I picked the most obvious and well-known one out there, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

So here you are, on what must be the tenth incarnation of my personal website and blog. I'll try to post witty, compelling, useful things on this blog. And if I don't, it'll be open source, so you can submit a pull request to make me interesting. â€”b
